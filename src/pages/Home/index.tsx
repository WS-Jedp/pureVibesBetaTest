                We have designed this beta test to be simple. In order to qualify for the <span className='fw-bold text-success'>500 USD</span> raffle prize, you will be required to <span className='fw-bold text-success text-uppercase'>use the App Twice</span> and <span className='fw-bold text-success text-uppercase'>complete the Survey</span> about your experiences. Before beginning the beta test, you must accept the Terms of Use, read the rules, and review the Friend Referral Tabâ€” This will take about 10-20 minutes to complete.
